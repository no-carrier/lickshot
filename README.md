Sampler fi di YouTube selectors dem!

Have you ever wanted to play sound effects and have the ability to pull up tunes while listening to reggae on Youtube? I did, so I made this extension.

It's easy to use: click on the airhon extension icon and then click the beep, horn, laser, or gunshot buttons to hear the sounds. If you hit the rewind button you'll hear a sound and the current page will reload. Change the volume with the slider below the buttons.
